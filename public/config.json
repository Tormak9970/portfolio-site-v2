This was because I added a secondary feature to my tool, the ability to download a <i>.zip</i> file with all of the nessesary information to recreate the character in Blender. This in tandem with other tools I have made expedites the extraction process. Since finishing the <i>Character Designer</i>, I continue to help people, as well as work to make the process even easier.",

			"description": "I got involved with TORCommunity after the owner and head dev of the site reached out to me while I was working on the <i>Character and Outfit Designer</i> and asked if I would be willing to put it up on TORCommunity. He had been looking for a tool just like it for the site for a while, and I was hoping to get it up on one of the fan sites as well. After finishing the app, and putting it up live on the site, he offered me the opportunity to continue working on the site, which I gladly took him up on. Since then, I have continued to work on the <i>Character and Outfit Designer</i>, as well as other parts of the site.",
