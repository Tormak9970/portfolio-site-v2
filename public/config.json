			"description": "I became a collaborator (essentially I work on new tools and techniques for the community, and help people whenever they have questions) because of my work on the <i>Character and Outfit Designer</i>. This was because I added a secondary feature to my tool, the ability to download a <i>.zip</i> file with all of the nessesary information to recreate the character in Blender. This, combined with a script I wrote to automatically  locates all the models and textures, takes a process that used to take over 1 hour, and makes it take under 20 minutes. Since finishing that, I continue to help people, as well as work to make the process even easier.",

The sites goal is to provide great resources, and improve the experience players have while playing the game.",
			"description": "I got involved with TORCommunity after the owner and head dev of the site reached out to me while I was working on the <i>Character and Outfit Designer</i> and asked if I would be willing to put it up on TORCommunity. He had been looking for a tool just like it for the site for a while, and I was hoping to get it up on one of the fan sites as well. After finishing the app, and putting it up live on the site, he offered me the opportunity to continue working on the site, which I gladly took him up on. Since then, I have continued to work on the <i>Character and Outfit Designer</i>, as well as other parts of the site.",
